# CSS Modals

Modals build out of pure CSS


## What is it

### Build with pure CSS
CSS Modal is build out of pure CSS. JavaScript is only for sugar. This makes
them perfectly accessible.

### Optimized for mobile
The modals are designed using responsive web design methods. They work on all
screen sizes from a small mobile phone up to high resolution screens.

### Use as Sass plugin
You can use CSS Modal as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) plugin and apply it to
your custom classes. No need to understand all the code.

### A few other advantages
accessible, cross-browser, media-adaptive, small and fast!


## How to use

Please visit [the website's section](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#howto-markup)
on how to use the CSS Modal.


## Browser Support

This modal is designed to work on all modern browsers. This does not include
Internet Explorer 7 or lower.


## Heads up

Please be aware that you need to stop playing videos or audio manually after
hiding the modal.

There is an event that is fired on the modal itself after the modal is show
which is called `cssmodal:show` and an event after the modal is hidden called
`cssmodal:hide`.

There events are not fired in IE8. Please be aware of that and use jQuery or
something else to create custom events.
